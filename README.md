**ABSTRACT**

In this work, we propose and analyze a new photovoltaic architecture, the down-converting multijunction (DC-MJ) solar cell, and explore the potential for further efficiency gains through the inclusion of up-conversion layers. Using a detailed balance framework and a differential evolution optimization algorithm, we determine the maximum theoretical efficiencies for various configurations. Our model finds a theoretical peak efficiency of 63.8%, exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit and surpassing conventional multijunction (MJ) cells. Lastly, we discuss the potential engineering and fabrication challenges associated with creating such hybrid devices and suggest future directions for research. With continued progress in material synthesis and photonic engineering, these hybrid architectures could provide a pathway toward the next generation of ultra-high-efficiency photovoltaics.
